# Draconic SWEP Base

_____

This is a SWEP Base made by Vuthakral, for the game "Garry's Mod".

The intent & goal of this SWEP base is to offer developers of both low & high levels an in-depth weapon base that uses as little network usage as possible while still enabling complete freedom of these content developers to do anything they want.
