**Preamble**: The Draconic Base license is under the assumption of "All rights reserved". Unless it is explicitly stated here, it is not allowed.
# 
**Terminology**:
- "the base": Anything that is part of the Draconic Base itself.
- "user content": Anything that is made by developers which relies on the Draconic Base.
- "developer(s)": Individuals that create content which relies on the Draconic Base.
- "player(s)": People who are just playing the game with the Draconic Base & content that relies on it.

### End User License Agreement

The Summary
As a PLAYER, you are obviously completely free to download & install the base. You do not own anything from the base nor user content made with it.
As a DEVELOPER, any user content you create which relies on the Draconic Base is solely your own. You do not own anything from the base itself, and may not redistribute the base, nor anything from it.

Terms
- (**1**) As an individual with access to the base you will not reupload it to any content sharing platforms, as this creates the potential for file and version conflicts which can break the base as a whole.
- (**2**) You will not sell, trade, nor bargain the base.
- (**3**) While modification of the base is allowed, as per point one you may not distribute the modified version of the base. This means you may create an edited version for use on a server, or group of servers that you own or develop on.

Takedowns
Failure to comply with the EULA above will result in a takedown issued to the offending party in whatever form is applicable to the platform that is being used.

tl;dr: don't reupload my shit
